                <h2>Intro</h2>
                <p>&emsp;The 2019 United Kingdom general election was held on 12 December 2019. The Conservative Party, having failed to obtain a majority in the 2017 general election, had faced a prolonged parliamentary deadlock over Brexit while it governed in minority with the support of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).</p>
                <p>&emsp;In July 2019, Boris Johnson was elected as the Conservatives' leader and appointed as Prime Minister, after Theresa May's resignation. Johnson could not get Parliament to approve a revised withdrawal agreement by the end of October, and chose to call for a snap election. The House of Commons supported the Early Parliamentary General Election Act 2019 by 438-20, setting the election date for 12 December. Johnson needed to obtain an overall majority in the election in order to accomplish his main goal of taking the United Kingdom out of the European Union by the end of January 2020. Opinion polls up to polling day showed a firm lead for the Conservatives against Labour throughout the campaign.</p>
                <p>&emsp;The election resulted in a Conservative win with a landslide majority of 80 seats (their largest majority since 1987), with the party making a net gain of 48 seats and winning 43.6% of the vote (the highest percentage by any party since 1979). The Labour Party performed poorly, making a net loss of 60 seats while winning 32.1% of the vote. The Scottish National Party (SNP) made a net gain of 13 seats and won 3.9% of the vote. The Liberal Democrats improved their vote share to 11.6% in the election, but made a net loss of one seat. The election also saw both the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) and Alliance Party of Northern Ireland re-gain representation in the Commons.</p>
                <p>&emsp;The result of the election saw the Conservatives strengthening their position on Brexit, with Johnson committing himself to ensuring the UK's departure from the European Union by 31 January 2020. For Corbyn, Labour won the fewest seats since the 1935 general election, and led to him announcing his intention to resign as promised in the event of his party's failure in the election. For Liberal Democrats leader Jo Swinson, the loss of her constituency's seat obliged her to resign the leadership of her party. For the SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon, her party's success led to her renewed hope for a second independence referendum which was opposed before the election by the Conservative Party.</p>

                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>&emsp;Theresa May began 2019 as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. The second May ministry was unable to pass the Brexit withdrawal agreement by 31 March 2019, so some political commentators considered that an early United Kingdom general election was likely. The opposition Labour Party called for a January 2019 vote of confidence in the May ministry, but the motion failed. After May resigned after the 2019 European Parliament election, during the first extension granted for negotiations on the withdrawal agreement, Boris Johnson won the 2019 Conservative Party leadership election and became prime minister on 23 July 2019. Along with attempting to revise the withdrawal agreement arranged by his predecessor's negotiations, Johnson made three attempts for a snap election under the process defined in the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, which requires a two-thirds supermajority in support of this.</p>
                <p>&emsp;All three attempts failed to gain support, while Johnson faced increasing pressure to secure a deal for the United Kingdom, following the enactment of the European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 2) Act 2019 (referred to as the "Benn Act") which prevented him from taking the country out of the EU without a deal. After failing to pass a revised deal before the first extension's deadline of 31 October 2019, Johnson was forced to call for a second extension on negotiations from the EU, and agreed upon holding a vote in the House of Commons for a snap election through a proposal forwarded by the Liberal Democrats and Scottish National parties on 28 October. The Early Parliamentary General Election Act 2019 (EPGEA) won a majority in the Commons by 438 votes to 20; an attempt to pass an amendment by opposition parties for the election to be held on 9 December failed by 315 votes to 295. The House of Lords followed suit on 30 October, with Royal Assent made the day after for the ratification of the EPGEA.</p>

                <h2>Date of the election</h2>
                <p>&emsp;The deadline for candidate nominations was 14 November 2019, with political campaigning for four weeks until polling day on 12 December. On the day of the election, polling stations across the country were open from 7 am, and closed at 10 pm. This date occurred despite the FTPA, which introduced fixed-term parliaments to the United Kingdom, with elections having been scheduled on the Thursday 5 May 2022. The date chosen for the 2019 general election made it the first to be held in December since 1923.</p>

                <h3>Voting eligibility</h3>
                <p>&emsp;Individuals eligible to vote had to be registered to vote by midnight on 26 November. To be eligible to vote, individuals had to be aged 18 or over; residing as a Commonwealth citizen at an address in the United Kingdom,[n 5] or a British citizen overseas who registered to vote in the last 15 years;[n 6] and not legally excluded (on grounds of detainment in prison, a mental hospital, or on the run from law enforcement) or disqualified from voting. Anyone who qualified as an anonymous elector had until midnight on 6 December to register.[n 7]</p>

                <h2>Campaign</h2>
                <p>&emsp;The Conservative Party and Labour Party have been the two biggest political parties, and have supplied every Prime Minister, since 1922. The Conservative Party have governed since the 2010 election, in coalition with the Liberal Democrats from 2010 to 2015. At the 2015 general election the Conservative Party committed to offering a referendum on whether the UK should leave the European Union and won a majority in that election. A referendum was held in June 2016, and the Leave campaign won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The UK initiated the withdrawal process in March 2017, and Prime Minister Theresa May triggered a snap general election in 2017, in order to demonstrate support for her planned negotiation of Brexit. The Conservative Party won a plurality of MPs, but not a majority; they formed a minority government, with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) as their confidence and supply partner. Neither May nor her successor Boris Johnson (winner of the 2019 Conservative Party leadership election) was able to secure parliamentary support either for a deal on the terms of the UK's exit from the EU, or for exiting the EU without an agreed deal. Johnson later succeeded in bringing his Withdrawal Agreement to a second reading in Parliament, following another extension until January 2020.</p>
                <p>&emsp;During the lifespan of the 2017 parliament, twenty MPs quit their parties, most due to disputes with their party leaderships; some formed new parties and alliances. In February 2019, eight Labour and three Conservative MPs resigned from their parties to sit together as The Independent Group. Having undergone a split and two name changes, at dissolution this group numbered five MPs who sat as the registered party The Independent Group for Change under the leadership of Anna Soubry. Two MPs sat in a group called The Independents (which at its peak had five members), one MP created the Birkenhead Social Justice Party, while a further 20 MPs who began as Labour or Conservative ended the Parliament as unaffiliated independents. Seven MPs, from both the Conservatives and Labour, joined the Liberal Democrats during the parliament, in combination with a by-election gain. The Lib Dems ultimately raised their number from 12 at the election to 20 at dissolution.</p>
                <p>&emsp;One reason for the defections from the Labour Party was the ongoing allegations of antisemitism and allegations that Jeremy Corbyn and the party leadership had not done enough to tackle the problem. Labour entered the election campaign undergoing investigation by the Equality and Human Rights Commission. The Jewish Labour Movement declared it would not generally campaign for Labour. The Conservative Party has also been criticised for not doing enough about alleged Islamophobia in the party.</p>
                <p>&emsp;Also due to defections, the Conservatives ended the previous parliamentary period with fewer seats than they had started with because they had expelled a number of MPs for going against the party line on a Brexit related vote. Ten of the 21 MPs expelled were subsequently reinstated, while others continued as independents.</p>

                <h2>Policy Positions</h2>

                <h3>Brexit</h3>
                <p>&emsp;The major parties had a wide variety of stances on Brexit. The Conservative Party supported leaving under the terms of the withdrawal agreement as negotiated by Johnson (amending Theresa May's previous agreement), and this agreement formed a central part of the Conservative campaign. The Brexit Party were in favour of a "no-deal Brexit", with their leader Farage calling for Johnson to drop the deal.</p>
                <p>&emsp;The Labour Party position was that a Labour government would renegotiate the withdrawal agreement (towards a closer post-withdrawal association with the EU) and would then put this forward as an option in a referendum against remaining in the EU. The Labour Party's campaigning stance in that referendum would be decided at a special conference. In a Question Time special featuring four party leaders, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said that he would stay neutral in the referendum campaign.</p>
                <p>&emsp;The Liberal Democrats, Scottish National Party (SNP), Plaid Cymru, The Independent Group for Change, and the Green Party of England and Wales were all opposed to Brexit, and proposed that a further referendum be held with the option - for which they would campaign - to remain in the EU. The Liberal Democrats originally pledged that if they formed a majority government (considered a highly unlikely outcome by observers), they would revoke the Article 50 notification immediately and cancel Brexit. Part-way through the campaign, the Liberal Democrats dropped the policy of revoking Article 50 after the party realised it was not going to win a majority in the election.</p>
                <p>&emsp;The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) was in favour of a withdrawal agreement in principle, but it opposed the deals negotiated by both May and Johnson, believing that they create too great a divide between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Sinn Féin, the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) and Alliance all favoured remaining in the EU. The UUP did not see a second referendum as a necessary route to achieving this goal.</p>

                <h3>Tax and spending commitments</h3>
                <p>&emsp;In September 2019, the Conservative government performed a spending review, where they announced plans to increase public spending by £13.8 billion/year, and reaffirmed plans to spend another £33.9 billion/year on the NHS by 2023. Chancellor Sajid Javid said the government had turned the page on 10 years of austerity. During the election the parties produced manifestos that outlined spending in addition to those already planned.</p>
                <p>&emsp;The Conservative manifesto was described as having "little in the way of changes to tax" by the Institute for Fiscal Studies. The decision to keep the rate of corporation tax at 19%, and not reduce it to 17% as planned, is expected to raise £6 billion/year. The plan to increase the national insurance threshold for employees and self-employed to £9,500 will cost £2 billion/year. They also committed to not raise rates of income tax, National Insurance or VAT. There are increased spending commitments of £3 billion current spending and £8 billion investment spending. This would overall lead to the UK's debt as a percentage of GDP remaining stable (the IFS assess it would rise in the event of a no-deal Brexit).</p>
                <p>&emsp;The Labour manifesto had planned to raise an extra £78 billion/year from taxes over the course of the parliament, with sources including:</p>
                <p>&emsp;£24bn - raising the headline rate of corporation tax to 26%</p>
                <p>&emsp;£6.3bn - tax multinationals' global profits according to UK share of global employment/assets/sales, not UK profits</p>
                <p>&emsp;£4.0bn - abolish patent box & R&D tax credit for large companies</p>
                <p>&emsp;£4.3bn - cutting unspecified corporation tax reliefs</p>
                <p>&emsp;£9bn - financial transactions tax</p>
                <p>&emsp;£14bn - dividends and capital gains</p>
                <p>&emsp;£6bn - anti-avoidance</p>
                <p>&emsp;£5bn - increases in income tax rates above £80,000/year</p>
                <p>&emsp;£5bn - other</p>
                <p>&emsp;In addition Labour will get income from the Inclusive Ownership Fund, windfall tax on oil companies and some smaller tax changes. There are increased spending commitments of £98 billion current spending and £55 billion investment spending. This would overall lead to the UK's debt as a percentage of GDP rising; Labour's John McDonnell said borrowing would only be for investment and one-offs (e.g. compensating WASPI women, not shown above), and not for day to day spending.</p>
                <p>&emsp;The Liberal Democrat manifesto plans to raise an extra £36 billion/year from taxes over the course of the parliament, with sources including:</p>
                <p>&emsp;£10bn - raising corporation tax to 20%</p>
                <p>&emsp;£7bn - 1% point rise in all rates of income tax</p>
                <p>&emsp;£5bn - abolish CGT allowance</p>
                <p>&emsp;£5bn - air passenger duty on frequent flyers</p>
                <p>&emsp;£6bn - anti-avoidance</p>
                <p>&emsp;£3bn - other</p>
                <p>&emsp;There are increased commitments of £37 billion current spending and £26 billion investment spending, which would overall lead to the UK's debt as a percentage of GDP falling, partly due to improved economic conditions which would result from staying in the EU.</p>

                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>&emsp;The Conservative Party won a landslide victory securing 365 seats out of 650, giving them an overall majority of 80. The Conservatives gained seats in several Labour Party strongholds in Northern England, flipping seats that were held by Labour for decades. Bishop Auckland elected a Conservative for the first time in its 134-year history as constituency. In the worst results for the party in more than 80 years, Labour lost a total of 60 seats reducing them to 202 seats, not including the Speaker, a Labour MP. Although they increased vote share, the Liberal Democrats failed to gain the results in seats that they had hoped for: they both lost and won seats, for a net reduction of 1, reducing them to 11 seats in the new parliament.</p>
                <p>&emsp;The Scottish National Party gained 13 seats, winning 48 of the 59 seats in Scotland. The SNP's leader Nicola Sturgeon described the result as a clear mandate to hold a new referendum for Scottish independence.</p>
